+ the SIMD instruction compatibility
## description

## resources

## division of work
we only have group of two and a small project, because all three parts is all base on the part before it, so we are going to do it all together with online meeting, following weekly schedule

## weekly schedule
+ Mar.10-Mar.15 collecting material and play with the P0 source code to get familiar with it and locate the position we need to midify or add code on
+ Mar.15-Mar.22 start the code with float type and let the type capable for all basic operation
+ Mar.22-Mar.29 satrt the covertion part,include(toInt,toFloat)maybe ceil,floor,round if we have time
+ Mar.29-Apr.5 start the SIMD part, test the compatibility with all other functions involved with floating type.
+ Apr.5-Apr.12 do some packageup work, make instruction of compile it, summarize the test case and finish our presentation preparation, clear all work we left in the last few weeks.
###### note:the presentation slides and testcase,resourses we refer to will be edit at every week.
